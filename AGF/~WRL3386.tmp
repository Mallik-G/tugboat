Customizing this approach
-------------------------

This document describes the formation of a CCoE. This guidance should be thought
of as a generic proposal and not a one-size-fits-all design. The size of your
organization and how it is structured should be taken into account when creating
your CCoE. Feel free to customize this approach as needed. Instead of six
committees you may find that breaking up the Security Committee into separate
groups for Identity and Networking makes more sense in your organization - or
you may find that the Automation and Product Catalog Committees should be
merged. These are perfectly acceptable if the approach you take produces the
desired results. The details listed here is available for those organizations
looking for a place to start.

Executive sponsorship
---------------------

Before you undertake the AGF or the formation of a CCoE is it imperative that
you have an executive sponsor. This approach is forward-looking and disruptive
to the way IT organizations have been run historically. You should expect to
encounter resistance, either to cloud in general or this approach in particular
(typically arguing instead for the “Extend the DC” model described in the [AGF
Introduction](https://github.com/gosson/azure-governance-foundations/blob/master/AGF/100-AGF%20Introduction.md)).
Ideally your sponsor should be a C-level executive (CIO, CTO, etc.) and one who
shares the vision of modernizing IT and evolving it from a technology broker to
a business partner. Again, depending on the size and complexity of your
organization, this may not be feasible but secure a sponsor with as much power
and authority as possible. Their endorsement will facilitate the creation of
these groups and provide a mantel of authority under which they will operate.

Once your sponsor has been identified, they should nominate someone to head the
CCoE (as they will probably not have the time to do this themselves). This
person will be charged with the actual creation of the groups, nomination of
membership and general day-today activities. They will also bring the sponsor in
when organizational roadblocks occur at least until such a time as the charter,
direction and endorsement of the CCoE is widely understood within the
organization.

General approach
----------------

At its core, the CCoE can be thought of as a parliamentary system with multiple
assemblies (technically a multicameral governing body) in which each assembly
(or committee) represents an aspect of the technology transformation: Platform,
Security, Monitoring, etc. and is responsible for governing that aspect. The
committees control their own destiny with respect to their areas but require
consensus on matters that affect other committees for the CCoE as whole. A
committee brings their proposal to the full CCoE to be discussed and ultimately
ratified. If during this discussion, it becomes clear that the policy will
affect other committees, the affected committees should come to an agreement. If
they cannot, the full CCoE may vote on such matters.

Below are a few examples to help clarify this approach:

#### Example 1:

The Monitoring committee submits a policy where every new container that is
deployed must have logging enabled and be configured to send those logs to a
specified workspace so that it can be viewed by Azure Monitor. During
discussion, a representative from the Architecture asks if the current
architecture design for Azure Kubernetes Service needs to be modified to
accommodate this change. The Monitoring committee explains that the policy will
automatically be applied to new containers without any changes to the design and
that existing containers can be updated with a simple script generated by the
policy engine. The Architecture team having been satisfied that they are
unaffected has no objection to the policy.

Because this policy does not affect other committees, the details of the policy
(what amount of logging and where the log go) are solely the purview of the
Monitoring Committee. Nonetheless it is important to submit the policy for
ratification so that the CCoE understands what the policy does and has a chance
to ask questions about it.

#### Example 2:

The Platform committee decides that having a large number of Azure subscriptions
(one for each application) is desirable. When the Platform committee brings that
policy to the full CCoE to be discussed, the Security committee raises a
technical consideration – namely that the current Azure limitation for vnet
peerings is 100. If the organization will have more than 100 subscriptions,
connectivity between subscriptions will need to be addressed differently that
they had planned. Since this policy does affect more than one committee the
committees need to find an amicable resolution or have the entire CCoE vote on
the policy.

In this case during discussion the CCoE determines that there are only 20
applications currently in the plan and that at the rate of growth is will be at
least three years until the organization reaches 100 applications. Given the
expected timeframe the Networking committee withdraws its objection with the
expectation that the technical limit (which has grown over time) is likely to
continue to grow and meet their needs.

If the Networking committee had not withdrawn its objection and was unable to
reach a consensus with the Platform Committee, the CCoE would then vote of the
matter with each member weighing the merits and risks of the policy.

Membership
----------

The CCoE, as a whole, is composed of the person nominated by the executive
sponsor (Mgmt Authority in the diagram below) acting as chair, a SCRUM master or
program manager and a representative from each committee.

Each committee must contain at least one member (but generally not more than
six). Some committees can share memberships where appropriate. For example, a
member of the Security committee would also be at home as a member of the
product Catalog committee (since the certification of products in the catalog
has a security element). This might also be a necessity if the number or
resources that can be dedicated to CCoE work is minimal

![](media/819016f56504dee1d5110f2ada273c6d.png)

There should also be at least one project manager (or SCRUM manager) for each
committee as well as the CCoE. The same PM can manage the responsibility across
multiple committees if time/resourcing permits.

NOTE: In larger organizations the creation of a Project Management Committee
would not be out of place.

In a smaller organization with resource constraints the CCoE might be as small
as six people (four committees of one plus the PM and a chairperson. A CCoE
smaller than this is discouraged as it is likely too daunting and demanding for
those resources.

What is a CCoE?
---------------

A Cloud Center of Excellence is a group dedicated to maintaining a secure,
compliant and well-governed cloud. The CCoE is made up of representatives from
the areas of the business that are affected by the cloud. Each of the members of
the CCoE are experts in their respective areas both in the on-premise world and
in the cloud. The CCoE is broken up into committees (or team of teams) which
focus on specific areas of the cloud. Typically, these are:

-   Platform governance

-   Security

-   Architecture

-   Monitoring

-   Automation

-   Product Catalog

-   DevOps

-   Data

-   Program Management

Each of these committees are focused on their area and they create the policies
which will ultimately be enforced by the cloud. While the committees control
their own destiny with respect to their area, they do not operate in a vacuum.
As the committees create policies, they submit them back to the larger CCoE for
comments and ratification. In this way, no one group operates without oversight
and policies that are proposed are reviewed for any potential impact upon other
groups or the cloud as a whole (this is imperative as policy decision may have
unintended consequences for other committees).

![](media/78c3405e436b8a272e2dba10b97f7d05.png)

The CCoE achieves control over the cloud by using cloud-native tools to meet the
organization’s needs. By building a secure framework they can step back and
allow business units to consume the cloud without the same obstacles that the
traditional approach creates.

### Hallmarks of a CCoE

A CCoE will create its own specific charter that will dictate how it operates in
specific but in general terms there are a few common hallmarks of a CCoE model:

-   Service Broker Approach

-   Loosely Coupled Architectures

-   Re-use of certified cloud services

-   Use of Cloud-native tooling

-   Cloud Native Controls

-   Zero touch implementations

-   Infrastructure as code

-   A cloud native operating model

These hallmarks are detailed in the [Building a Cloud Center of
Excellence](https://github.com/gosson/azure-governance-foundations/blob/master/AGF/101-Building-a-Cloud-Center-of-Excellence.md)
guide.

![](media/b728c00fe4137836a58d7514e266713f.png)

During the initial phases of this approach, expect members to have a full-time
or near-full-time commitment. Between the training needed, research,
experimentation and proposals a great deal of time needs to be invested by
members.

If all members of the CCoE were already considered experts in their respective
areas of cloud, the AGF might be completed in as little as one month. However,
since at least some training and ramp up is typically required a more realistic
timeframe is 90 days.

During this time, the CCoE should meet at least weekly with the intervening time
dedicated to the work of individual committees which may be meeting daily.

After the foundations haven been completed and the platform is ready to accept
workloads (at the completion of the work described in the AGF), the time
commitment may be reduced. The amount of time the CCoE needs to invest will then
be a function of the number of workloads expected and how close the platform
gets to achieving a ‘steady state’.

In smaller organizations in a steady state, committee membership may drop to a
single person with CCoE meeting happening as infrequently as monthly. In large
organizations membership generally continues to be a full-time commitment,
although the size of the committees may shrink.

As the rate of consumption of new cloud services rises within an organization,
the benefits that cloud offers becomes fully realized and IT department’s
transformation from man-in-the-middle acquiring new hardware to a true business
partner enabling their companies to achieve more.
