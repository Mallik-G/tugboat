## What is DevOps?

The question of "What is DevOps?" is an exhaustive question that has been thoroughly discussed by such authoritative as [The Phoneix Project]() and the [The DevOps Handbook](). For the purpose of the CAF in general, and the DevOps Committee definition specifically, this document will focus on the following definition:

> **DevOps is a set of applied principles and processes that focus on the optimization of a system as a whole.** 

This definition leads to a couple critical conclusions:

* IT has become an operational extension of the core business; ingesting ideas (requirements) and delivering the generated business value to the end user.
* Local optimizations are wasted effort as they do not address the true bottle neck. Local optimization will just enable work to move more quickly to the bottleneck creating a system modeled on "hurry up and wait".
