Dev-Ops Committee

## What is DevOps?

The question of "What is DevOps?" is a question that has been thoroughly and exhaustively covered by many publications. For the purpose of the CAF in general, and the DevOps Committee definition specifically, this document will focus on the following definition of DevOps:

> **DevOps is a set of applied principles and processes that focus on the optimization of a system as a whole.** 

This focused definition leads to a couple critical conclusions:

* IT is an operational partner of the core business; ingesting ideas (requirements) and delivering the generated business value to the end user.
* Local optimizations are wasted effort as they do not address the true bottle neck. Local optimization will just enable work to move more quickly to the bottleneck creating a system modeled on "hurry up and wait".  

## IT Operating models

### Optimizing for Cost

Most IT organizations that predate the cloud era are structured based on the most effective use of resources. This typically takes the form of organizations that are divided based upon functional area: DBA team, networking team, security team, development team, storage team, etc... This enables the organization to optimize for cost by striving to maximize the utilization of these single function teams.

### Optimizing for Business Value Delivery

In contrast to the cost optimized operating model, many born-in-the-cloud IT organizations have embraced a product centric model that focuses on ensuring a particular product delivery team contains all of the skillsets necessary in order to build, deploy and operate that product throughout its lifecycle. This leads to the creation of cross-functional teams that are very closely aligned to the core business.

Regardless of the path pursued, the goal of the modern IT organization is to reduce friction to a minimum and enable product delivery teams to respond to the needs of the business as quickly as possible while still maintaining necessary controls. This has lead to the rise of "Ticketless IT" in which delivery teams can self-serve any necessary IT infrastructure in support of their business aligned objectives.
